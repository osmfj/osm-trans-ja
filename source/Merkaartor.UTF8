== Problems and solutions ==

'''multi polygon causes program crash'''

Sometimes the function ''add to multi polygon'' causes a program crash. Therefore before creating one, the file should be saved. If it crashes again, ''add to relation'' can be used, which doesn't crash. Then the roles ''inner'' and ''outer'' must be added manually.


'''precondition failed'''

When uploading, a error message can appear, which says ''precondition failed. Node <xy> still in use''. This might happen on deleting objects. If so, export the file to .osc-format and open it. In the <modify></modify> section you must delete these named objects manually (xml-editor or notepad). After that, import it again and try uploading again.


'''<object with negative number> not found'''

This might occur on upload, if an already uploaded object is modified again. For solving, export to .osc-format, open the file and delete the part (xml-editor or notepad). Then import the file again.
